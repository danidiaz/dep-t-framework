# dep-t-framework

Calling this a "framework" is something of a stretch. 

- **dep-t** The main package. Basic utilities for dependency injection using records-of-functions.
- **dep-t-advice** Arity-generic function decorators, also function invocation helpers.
- **dep-t-dynamic** Dependency injection environments with dynamic fields. 
- **dep-t-value-sqlite** Read resources from an SQLite database file. (UNDER CONSTRUCTION.)
